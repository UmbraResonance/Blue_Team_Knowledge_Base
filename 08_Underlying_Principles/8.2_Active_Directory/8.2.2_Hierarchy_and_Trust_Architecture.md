# Hierarchy and Trust Architecture

## Overview
Active Directory follows a geopolitical model to organize resources. This hierarchical structure allows for granular management at the local level (Domains) while maintaining centralized orchestration at the enterprise level (Forests).

## Underlying Principles
### Scaling and Isolation
- **Domain:** A logical group of objects (users, computers, OUs) serving as a boundary for administration and security.
- **Tree:** A collection of domains sharing a contiguous namespace (e.g., `corp.inlanefreight.local` under `inlanefreight.local`).
- **Forest:** The topmost container. It defines the security boundary for the entire enterprise. Each forest operates independently but can be connected via trust relationships.

## Key Components
### 1. Global Catalog (GC)
The GC is a Domain Controller that holds a full replica of its own domain and a partial replica of every other domain in the forest.
- **Internal Logic:** It functions as a forest-wide cache, enabling "Object Search" transparency across the entire hierarchy without requiring the client to know the object's physical location.

### 2. Read-Only Domain Controller (RODC)
Designed for low-security physical locations. It maintains a read-only database and restricts password caching, significantly reducing the attack surface in branch offices.

## Security and Hunting Implications
- **Trust Transitivity:** Understanding parent-child relationships is vital for mapping lateral movement paths. A compromise in a child domain can potentially escalate to the forest root if trusts are mismanaged.
- **Global Catalog Reconnaissance:** Attackers often query the GC to identify high-value targets across multiple domains without triggering alerts associated with direct LDAP queries to remote DCs.
