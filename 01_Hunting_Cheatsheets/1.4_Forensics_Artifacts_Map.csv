Windows_Persistence,Detect Boot Persistence ,Registry: Run Keys,HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run,Classic persistence. Programs listed here start automatically on system boot.
Windows_Persistence,Detect One-Time Run,Registry: RunOnce,HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,Programs run once at next boot then delete the key. Often used by malware installers/cleanup scripts.
Windows_Persistence,Detect Malicious Services,Registry: Services,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services,Check for services launching binaries from Temp/AppData. Look for 'ImagePath' pointing to suspicious locations.
Windows_Persistence,Detect Scheduled Jobs,Scheduled Tasks (*.xml),C:\Windows\System32\Tasks,Review task actions. Look for encoded PowerShell or tasks running suspicious scripts daily.
Windows_Persistence,Detect Login Persistence,Startup Folder,C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup,Simple persistence. Any file here runs when the specific user logs in.
Windows_Network,Correlate IP to Host,Registry: Network Interfaces,HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces,Maps Network Card GUIDs to static IP addresses or DHCP info. Links network logs to this specific host.
Windows_RecycleBin,Recover Deleted Data,Recycle Bin ($I / $R),C:\$Recycle.Bin\<SID>,Deleted files. Metadata file ($I) contains the original file name and deletion timestamp.
Linux_System,Identify OS Version ,OS Release File,/etc/os-release OR /etc/issue,Identifies Linux distribution and version. Essential for choosing correct volatility profiles.
Linux_Auth,Track User Logins,Auth Logs,/var/log/auth.log OR /var/log/secure,"Records SSH logins, sudo usage, and new user creation events."
Linux_Auth,Track Session Duration,Wtmp (Last Log),/var/log/wtmp,Binary file (read with 'last'). Shows exact login/logout times and reboots.
Linux_User,Analyze User Commands ,Bash History,~/.bash_history,"Command history. Look for 'wget', 'curl', 'nc', 'rm -rf', or base64 decoding loops."
Linux_User,Analyze File Edits,Vim History,~/.viminfo,Search history and file cursor positions for Vim. Can reveal which config files were modified.
