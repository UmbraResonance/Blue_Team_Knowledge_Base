Category,Investigation Goal (What we look for),Command / Plugin Syntax,Description / Analysis Tip
CLI_Basics,Basic Execution,python3 vol.py -f <IMAGE> <PLUGIN>,Standard Volatility 3 syntax. '-f' specifies the memory dump file.
CLI_Basics,Save Output,python3 vol.py -f <IMAGE> <PLUGIN>  > results.txt,Redirect stdout to a file. Essential for documenting evidence or grepping later.
CLI_Basics,Help / List Options,python3 vol.py <PLUGIN> -h,Shows specific flags for a plugin (e.g. how to dump files or filter by PID).
CLI_Basics,Verbose Mode,python3 vol.py -v -f <IMAGE> <PLUGIN>,Enables verbose output. Useful when a plugin crashes or hangs.
System,Identify OS Profile,windows.info,"Identifies the OS version, build number, and architecture. CRITICAL: Confirms if the memory image is readable before you start."
Process,List Active Processes,windows.pslist,Lists processes from the doubly-linked list. Standard view of what the OS 'thinks' is running.
Process,Find Hidden Processes,windows.psscan,Scans memory specifically for EPROCESS blocks. Comparing pslist vs psscan reveals Rootkits (DKOM)hiding processes.
Process,Analyze Process Tree,windows.pstree,Visualizes parent-child relationships. KEY: Look for anomalies like svchost.exe spawning cmd.exe or orphaned processes.
Process,Get Command Arguments,windows.cmdline,"Displays the exact command line used to launch the process. KEY: Reveals malware paths, flags, and encoded PowerShell scripts."
Process,Detect Injected Code,windows.malfind,Scans for memory pages with RWX (Read-Write-Execute) permissions. The #1 plugin for finding code injection and hollowed processes.
Process,Analyze DLLs,windows.dlllist,Lists loaded DLLs for a process. Look for DLLs running from Temp folders or uncommon paths.
Process,Find Hidden/Unlinked DLLs,windows.ldrmodules,"Compares the PEB lists (InLoad, InMemory, InInit). If a DLL is in one list but not others, it's likely hidden (DLL Injection)."
Process,Check Handles,windows.handles,"Lists open handles (files, registry keys, mutexes). Use --pidto see what specific resources a suspicious process is touching."
Network,List Connections,windows.netscan,Scans for TCP/UDP connections and listeners. Links an IP address to a specific Process ID (PID). Vital for attribution.
File,Find File Objects,windows.filescan,Scans memory for file objects. Use grep to find filenames even if they were deleted from disk.
File,Extract Files,windows.dumpfiles,Extracts the actual binary from memory to disk for AV scanning. Use with --virtaddr found in filescan.
Registry,Extract User Passwords,windows.hashdump,Extracts NTLM hashes from the SAM registry hive in memory. Can be used to crack passwords or verify credential theft.
Registry,Analyze Registry Keys,windows.registry.printkey,Prints specific registry keys from memory. Useful for checking 'Run' keys without mounting the disk image.
Misc,Check Last Error,windows.getlasterror,Gets the last error code for a thread. Can help understand why malware failed to execute or verify crash dumps.
Misc,Analyze Mutexes ,windows.mutantscan,Scans for Mutex objects. Malware uses specific Mutex names to avoid reinfecting the same host. Google the mutex names!
