## 📖 About This Field Manual

This repository is **not a textbook**; it is my **personal combat notebook**.

It serves as a centralized, living collection of tradecraft and detection strategies that I have researched, tested, and curated for my own use as a Security Analyst. The content here reflects my personal methodology in dissecting TTPs and translating them into actionable defense mechanisms.

The goal is to bridge the gap between abstract threat intelligence and the specific, often messy reality of log analysis in the field.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

I built this repository to solve specific challenges I encounter in daily operations:
1.  **Zero Friction Retrieval:** When an alert fires, I need the exact Wireshark filter or Volatility command *now*.
2.  **Detection-as-Code:** Moving from manual hunting queries to automated detection rules to prevent recurrence.
3.  **Strict SOPs:** Standardized templates to ensure findings are recorded with legal and forensic precision (Chain of Custody).
4.  **Engineering-First Approach:** Detections are not just "queries"; they follow a strict Detection Development Lifecycle (DDLC) to ensure quality, vendor-neutrality, and verifiable results.
5. **First-Principles Thinking:** Operational commands (01, 06) are backed by deep OS internals knowledge (08). We don't just run queries; we understand how the kernel generates the artifacts (e.g., Access Tokens, SACLs).
6. **Force Multiplication:** Codifying manual tradecraft and research (01-08) into automated, reusable modules (09) to ensure defense operates at machine speed.

## ⚡ Operational Workflow (Incident Lifecycle)

How to utilize this repository during a live incident:

### Phase 1: Triage & Detection
* **Trigger:** Alert received or anomaly detected.
* **Action:** Consult **`01_Hunting`** to interpret raw logs (Windows/Network).
* **Documentation:** Open **`7.1_Timeline_Tracker.csv`** immediately to start logging the narrative (Red & Blue actions).

### Phase 2: Investigation & Analysis
* **Action:** Use **`06_Tool_Vault`** to execute precise forensic collection.
* **Action:** Log all extracted files into **`7.2_Evidence_Artifact_Log.csv`** (Chain of Custody).
* **Deep Dive:** If malware is recovered, analyze using **`04_Malware`** and produce **`7.3_Malware_Analysis_Report.md`**.

### Phase 3: Containment & Intelligence
* **Action:** Execute containment steps from **`03_Playbooks`** and log them in the Timeline.
* **Attribution:** Pivot from artifacts to attribution using **`7.4_DFIR_to_CTI_Workbench.md`** (Diamond Model).

### Phase 4: Deliverable
* **Action:** Synthesize all findings into **`77.5_Final_Incident_Report_Template.md`**.
* **Continuous Improvement:** Feed lessons learned back into the [DDLC Workflow](./02_Detection_Rules/!DDLC_Workflow.md) to develop new, verified detection rules.

### Continuous Improvement (The Loop):
* **Gap Analysis:** If a detection was missed, verify existing logic in `01_Hunting`.
* **Deep Dive:** Consult 08_Underlying_Principles to understand the theoretical mechanism before writing new rules.
* **Engineering:** Codify verified hunting and response logic into **09_Automation_Vault** to automate repetitive tasks and ensure systemic prevention.

## 🛑 Standard Operation Procedure (SOP)

1.  **Write it Down:** If it's not in the *Timeline Tracker*, it didn't happen.
2.  **UTC is King:** All logs must be converted to UTC for correlation.
3.  **Hash Everything:** Never extract a file without calculating its SHA256 immediately.
4.  **Pivot:** Don't stop at the alert. Use the *CTI Workbench* to find the infrastructure behind the attack.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* **For Defense Only:** The techniques described here are for defensive security analysis, incident response, and educational purposes.
* **Context Matters:** Every environment is different. Validate logic before production deployment.
