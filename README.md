# Blue Team Threat Hunting Knowledge Base

> A centralized framework for curating detection logic, analyzing threat artifacts, and mapping TTPs across diverse environments.

## Project Overview
This repository serves as a personal knowledge management system for **Detection Engineering** and **Threat Hunting**. It bridges the gap between theoretical threat intelligence (MITRE ATT&CK) and practical, actionable queries (SPL/KQL).

The goal is not just to list tools, but to document the **detection nuance**—specifically focusing on data source variations, evasion techniques, and high-fidelity logic.
