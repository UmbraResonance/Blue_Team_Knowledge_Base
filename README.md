# Blue Team Threat Hunting Field Notes

> **My personal arsenal of detection logic, query syntax, and artifact analysis.**
> *Curated for operational utility and rapid deployment.*

## About This Field Manual
This repository is not a textbook; it is my **personal combat notebook**.

It serves as a centralized, living collection of tradecraft and detection strategies that I have researched, tested, and curated for my own use as a Security Analyst. The content here reflects my personal methodology in dissecting TTPs and translating them into actionable defense mechanisms.

The goal is to bridge the gap between abstract threat intelligence and the specific, often messy reality of log analysis in the field.

## Why This Exists (Design Philosophy)
I built this repository to solve specific challenges I encounter in daily operations
