## 1. Observable Triage (The "What")
*Paste raw artifacts. Filter out noise. Focus on High Confidence IOCs.*

| Artifact Type | Value | Context / Source | Enrichment (VT/Whois) | Confidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Command** | `net group "Domain Admins" /domain` | Sysmon ID 1 | Discovery Intent | High |
| **Process** | `tasklist /v` | Spawned by cmd.exe | Enumeration | Med |
| **IP** | `129.83.44.12` | Outbound HTTPS | C2 Known Bad | High |

## 2. TTP Extraction & MITRE Mapping (The "How")
*Translate observations into Behaviors. (Reference: Pineapple RAT Logic)*

| Observation | Tactic (Goal) | Technique ID | Technique Name | Reasoning / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ipconfig /all` | Discovery | **T1016** | System Network Config Discovery | Standard recon. |
| `net group...` | Discovery | **T1087.002** | Account Discovery: Domain Account | *Correction:* Prefer T1087 over T1018 because specific intent is Account enumeration. |
| Registry Run Key | Persistence | **T1547.001** | Reg Run Keys / Startup Folder | *Precision:* T1547 is more specific than T1112 (Modify Registry). |

## 3. The Diamond Model (The "Who & Why")
*Synthesize findings into the 4 corners.*

* **Adversary:** [Suspected Group or Motivation]
* **Capability:** [Tools used, e.g., Pineapple RAT, PowerShell]
* **Infrastructure:** [C2 IPs, Domains]
* **Victim:** [Affected Hosts, Data targeted]

---

## 4. Pivot & Hunting Plan (The "Next Step")
* **[ ] Network:** Search for traffic to C2 `129.83.44.12`.
* **[ ] Endpoint:** Hunt for `tasklist /v` execution by non-admin users.

## 5. Analytical QA & Review (The "Self-Check")
*Based on 'Pineapple RAT Practice' methodology. Reduce bias before publishing.*

### 5.1 Gap Analysis (Did I miss anything?)
* *Check:* Did I map the **intent**, not just the command?
* *Example:* `net group` is technically Discovery, but specifically **Domain Account** Discovery (T1087), not just System Discovery.
* **Missed TTPs:** [List any behaviors initially overlooked]

### 5.2 Precision Analysis (Is this too generic?)
* *Check:* Did I use a generic technique (e.g., T1059 Command Execution) when a more specific one exists?
* *Rule:* **Specificity over Generality.** (e.g., Use T1547.001 instead of T1112 if it's a Run Key).
* **Redundant TTPs Removed:** [List TTPs removed to reduce noise]
